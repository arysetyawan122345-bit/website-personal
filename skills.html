    <h1>My Skills</h1>
    <p>
      I have diverse skills and interests, both in fitness and problem solving. I am accustomed to maintaining my physical condition through running and gym workouts, which help build discipline, consistency, and endurance. In addition, I am interested in various types of digital games that train strategic thinking, focus, and teamwork skills. I also have the ability to analyze and troubleshoot issues with tools or devices, reflecting attention to detail, logical thinking, and strong problem-solving skills.
